### Q1
> Implement a program in which parent sorts an integer array. Then it creates a
> child process. The child accepts a number to be searched in the array, performs
> a binary search in the array and display the result. Appropriately modify the
> program to create scenarios to demonstrate that zombie and orphan states of the
> child can be formed.

## Answer

1. **For zombie process**: 
 - The parent is made to sleep for 10 second. Then, the child process accepts an
   input, searches it, displays the result, and exits.
 - When this happens, Ctrl+Z is used to stop the parent process, and *ps -s* is
   run. 
 - The output shows that the child process has zombied.

2. **For orphan process**:
 - The parent process is made to exit immediately without sleeping. Then the
   child process **tries to** access an input, searches, displays the result and
   leaves.
 - The child however **fails to execute scanf, and scanf returns -1, failing**.
   This is because when the parent exited, the child was adopted by *init*. Due
   to this it relenquishes control of *stdin*, causing scanf to fail.
 - The child then calls getppid(), and prints it's and the parent's PID. The
   ppid is **1**, which means the parent is *init*. This indicates that the
   child was *orphaned*.

## Q3

Write a program to create 2 child processes that ultimately become zombie
processes. The first child displays some message and immediately terminates. The
2nd child sleeps for 100 and then terminates. Inside the parent program using
“system” display the all the process stats and the program exits. Immediately on
the command prompt display the all the process stats. What happened to the
Zombie processes?

## Answer
- It has not been specified that the parent should wait. If the parent does not
  sleep for more than 100 second, then the child which sleeps **will become
  orphan, not zombie**.
- The child which exits immediately is zombied. This can be seen by first
  calling *ps* using system *inside* the program, and immediately calling *ps*
  after the main program exists on the command prompt. 
- The first *ps* (in the program) shows that one of the process is Zombie(Z), and
  the other is Sleeping(S).
- The second *ps* shows that the other process is Sleeping(S), and it's parent
  is init, indicated by the ppid printed.

**What happens to the zombie process**? 

The child which exits is zombied. When the parent exits, it effectively becomes
like an **orphan** gets attached to *init*. Because it has terminated, it gets
**reaped** by init. 

On the other hand, the child which is sleeping gets
orphaned, as the parent exits before it.

## Code

```{.c .numberLines startFrom="1"}


#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <errno.h>

void child_1_action(void) {
		printf("I am the first-born: %d\n", getpid());
		exit(0);
}

void child_2_action(void) {
		sleep(100);
		exit(0);
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {

		int childpid;
		void (*child_action[])(void) = {child_1_action, child_2_action};

		for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
				if ((childpid = fork()) == -1) {
						perror("fork");
						return errno;
				}
				else if (!childpid) {
						/* in child */
						child_action[i]();
						/* will never return here, function has exit() in it */
				}
				/* is parent */
		}

		if (system("ps -o command,pid,ppid,state") == -1) {
				perror("ps -o command,pid,ppid,state");
		}

		return 0;
}

```

## Output

![Zombied and Sleeping processes. The process which exits is seen as "Z" in the
first output, and the sleeping process is seen to have PPID = 1 (meaning it is
orphaned](3.png)
